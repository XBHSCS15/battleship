### Notes to Class ###

* From now if you want a commit for a change someone else must approve it. This will limit the amount of issues.
* If there are confilt issues when merging wait till class to commit them. We can look together and figure out what the problem   is and what code needs to stay.
* Do not commit directly to the master branch. Creat a new branch and name it somthing that makes sense and someone will aprove teh pull request.

These are just some small things if anyone else thinks that we should add more "code of conduct" just fork and make your own changes and someone else will aprove the commit back to the main branch.

Remember to check out the [GitHub Bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/) and the [Glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) before playing with Git.

You can mess around with this repo however you'd like to. Don't worry about breaking stuff; we haven't coded anything anyways. Just get comfortable opening the project in your IDE. 

*Instead of using your IDE's built in Git tools (which kinda suck), use GitHub Desktop (or command line if you're comfortable with it) by downloading it from the links at the top of this readme*

~~I (Anthony) have already created a NetBeans project inside this repo. That means that you should delete "Battleship" or "BattleshipOnline" projects before you start linking up the repo with your IDE. After you've successfully cloned this repo, you should be asked if you'd like to open the project "BattleshipOnline"~~

~~I would also read [this Netbeans howto guide](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html) regarding linking up the repo to your IDE. [This other article](https://github.com/benrbray/AdamBots-FIRST-2013-Robot-Code/wiki/How-To-Use-Git-&-Integrate-Git-With-NetBeans) is also pretty helpful and simplifies everything a bit.~~
